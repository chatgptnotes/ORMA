## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema

You need to run the Aadhaar table creation SQL in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to: https://wbbvhmmhhjgleoyvuxtq.supabase.co
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Create a new query
4. Copy and paste the contents of `sql/create_aadhar_records_table.sql`
5. Click "Run" to execute

**Alternatively**, if you have PostgreSQL client:
```bash
# Using psql (if you have the connection string)
psql "postgresql://postgres:[password]@[host]:[port]/postgres" < sql/create_aadhar_records_table.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file has:
```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDOvNDpQCWRSOffcaHhim9pMRlhhL_ChIs
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://wbbvhmmhhjgleoyvuxtq.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Gemini API Error
**Solution**: Check API key in `.env` file. Ensure `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set correctly.

### Issue: Fields Not Auto-filling
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify field mapping keys match form field labels
3. Check that extraction was successful (green ✅)
4. Look for console logs showing "STARTING FIELD MAPPING"

### Issue: Database Save Error
**Solution**:
1. Verify Supabase URL and keys in `.env`
2. Check that all SQL tables are created
3. Verify RLS policies are set correctly

### Issue: Wrong Document Type Detected
**Solution**: The system auto-detects document types. You can see detection results in browser console. If wrong, the pageType hint in the upload function should help guide detection.

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Add Progress Indicators**: Show percentage during extraction
2. **Add Document Preview**: Show thumbnails of uploaded documents
3. **Add Edit Capability**: Allow manual correction of extracted data
4. **Add Batch Upload**: Upload multiple documents at once
5. **Add OCR Confidence Scores**: Show confidence level for each field
6. **Add Document Verification**: Verify document authenticity
7. **Add Export Function**: Export filled form as PDF
